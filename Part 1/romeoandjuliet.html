        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br/>

        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br/>

        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br/>

        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br/>

        A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br/>

        Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows<br/>

        Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.<br/>

        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br/>

        And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br/>

        Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,<br/>

        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br/>

        The which if you with patient ears attend,<br/>

        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br/>

    Verona. A public place.</h2>

    <p id="id00047">Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house
    of Capulet.</p>

    <p id="id00048" style="margin-top: 2em">  Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>

    <p id="id00049">  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.</p>

    <p id="id00050">  Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.</p>

    <p id="id00051">  Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.</p>

    <p id="id00052">  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.</p>

    <p id="id00053">  Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</p>

    <p id="id00054">  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</p>

    <p id="id00055">  Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.<br/>

        Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00056">  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take<br/>

        the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00057">  Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the<br/>

        wall.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00058" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
        are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
        from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.</p>

    <p id="id00059">  Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.</p>

    <p id="id00060" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have
        fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
        their heads.</p>

    <p id="id00061">  Greg. The heads of the maids?</p>

    <p id="id00062">  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.<br/>

        Take it in what sense thou wilt.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00063">  Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.</p>

    <p id="id00064" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I
        am a pretty piece of flesh.</p>

    <p id="id00065" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst
        been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of
        Montagues.</p>

    <p id="id00066">           Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].</p>

    <p id="id00067" style="margin-top: 2em">  Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.</p>

    <p id="id00068">  Greg. How? turn thy back and run?</p>

    <p id="id00069">  Samp. Fear me not.</p>

    <p id="id00070">  Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!</p>

    <p id="id00071">  Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.</p>

    <p id="id00072">  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.</p>

    <p id="id00073" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
        disgrace to them, if they bear it.</p>

    <p id="id00074">  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p>

    <p id="id00075">  Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.</p>

    <p id="id00076">  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p>

    <p id="id00077">  Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?</p>

    <p id="id00078">  Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.</p>

    <p id="id00079" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
        thumb, sir.</p>

    <p id="id00080">  Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?</p>

    <p id="id00081">  Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.</p>

    <p id="id00082" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as
        you.</p>

    <p id="id00083">  Abr. No better.</p>

    <p id="id00084">  Samp. Well, sir.</p>

    <p id="id00085">                        Enter Benvolio.</p>

    <p id="id00086" style="margin-right: 2%; margin-left: 2%; margin-top: 2em">  Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my
        master's kinsmen.</p>

    <p id="id00087">  Samp. Yes, better, sir.</p>

    <p id="id00088">  Abr. You lie.</p>

    <p id="id00089">  Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.<br/>

                                                         They fight.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00090">  Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]<br/>

        Put up your swords. You know not what you do.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00091">                          Enter Tybalt.</p>

    <p id="id00092" style="margin-top: 2em">  Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?<br/>

        Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00093">  Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,<br/>

        Or manage it to part these men with me.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00094">  Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word<br/>

        As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.<br/>

        Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00095">     Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or<br/>

                              partisans.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00096" style="margin-top: 2em">  Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!</p>

    <p id="id00097">  Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!</p>

    <p id="id00098">           Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.</p>

    <p id="id00099" style="margin-top: 2em">  Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!</p>

    <p id="id00100">  Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?</p>

    <p id="id00101">  Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come<br/>

        And flourishes his blade in spite of me.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00102">                 Enter Old Montague and his Wife.</p>

    <p id="id00103" style="margin-top: 2em">  Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.</p>

    <p id="id00104">  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.</p>

    <p id="id00105">                Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.</p>

    <p id="id00106" style="margin-top: 2em">  Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,<br/>

        Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-<br/>

        Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,<br/>

        That quench the fire of your pernicious rage<br/>

        With purple fountains issuing from your veins!<br/>

        On pain of torture, from those bloody hands<br/>

        Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground<br/>

        And hear the sentence of your moved prince.<br/>

        Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word<br/>

        By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,<br/>

        Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets<br/>

        And made Verona's ancient citizens<br/>

        Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments<br/>

        To wield old partisans, in hands as old,<br/>

        Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.<br/>

        If ever you disturb our streets again,<br/>

        Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.<br/>

        For this time all the rest depart away.<br/>

        You, Capulet, shall go along with me;<br/>

        And, Montague, come you this afternoon,<br/>

        To know our farther pleasure in this case,<br/>

        To old Freetown, our common judgment place.<br/>

        Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.<br/>

                  Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00107">  Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?<br/>

        Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00108">  Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary<br/>

        And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.<br/>

        I drew to part them. In the instant came<br/>

        The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;<br/>

        Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,<br/>

        He swung about his head and cut the winds,<br/>

        Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.<br/>

        While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,<br/>

        Came more and more, and fought on part and part,<br/>

        Till the Prince came, who parted either part.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00109">  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?<br/>

        Right glad I am he was not at this fray.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00110">  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun<br/>

        Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,<br/>

        A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;<br/>

        Where, underneath the grove of sycamore<br/>

        That westward rooteth from the city's side,<br/>

        So early walking did I see your son.<br/>

        Towards him I made; but he was ware of me<br/>

        And stole into the covert of the wood.<br/>

        I- measuring his affections by my own,<br/>

        Which then most sought where most might not be found,<br/>

        Being one too many by my weary self-<br/>

        Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,<br/>

        And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00111">  Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,<br/>

        With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,<br/>

        Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;<br/>

        But all so soon as the all-cheering sun<br/>

        Should in the furthest East bean to draw<br/>

        The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,<br/>

        Away from light steals home my heavy son<br/>

        And private in his chamber pens himself,<br/>

        Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight<br/>

        And makes himself an artificial night.<br/>

        Black and portentous must this humour prove<br/>

        Unless good counsel may the cause remove.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00112">  Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</p>

    <p id="id00113">  Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him</p>

    <p id="id00114">  Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?</p>

    <p id="id00115">  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;<br/>

        But he, his own affections' counsellor,<br/>

        Is to himself- I will not say how true-<br/>

        But to himself so secret and so close,<br/>

        So far from sounding and discovery,<br/>

        As is the bud bit with an envious worm<br/>

        Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air<br/>

        Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.<br/>

        Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,<br/>

        We would as willingly give cure as know.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00116">                       Enter Romeo.</p>

    <p id="id00117" style="margin-top: 2em">  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,<br/>

        I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00118">  Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay<br/>

        To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,<br/>

                                         Exeunt [Montague and Wife].<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00119">  Ben. Good morrow, cousin.</p>

    <p id="id00120">  Rom. Is the day so young?</p>

    <p id="id00121">  Ben. But new struck nine.</p>

    <p id="id00122">  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.<br/>

        Was that my father that went hence so fast?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00123">  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?</p>

    <p id="id00124">  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.</p>

    <p id="id00125">  Ben. In love?</p>

    <p id="id00126">  Rom. Out-</p>

    <p id="id00127">  Ben. Of love?</p>

    <p id="id00128">  Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.</p>

    <p id="id00129">  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,<br/>

        Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00130">  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,<br/>

        Should without eyes see pathways to his will!<br/>

        Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?<br/>

        Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.<br/>

        Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.<br/>

        Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!<br/>

        O anything, of nothing first create!<br/>

        O heavy lightness! serious vanity!<br/>

        Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!<br/>

        Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!<br/>

        Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is<br/>

        This love feel I, that feel no love in this.<br/>

        Dost thou not laugh?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00131">  Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.</p>

    <p id="id00132">  Rom. Good heart, at what?</p>

    <p id="id00133">  Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.</p>

    <p id="id00134">  Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.<br/>

        Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,<br/>

        Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest<br/>

        With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown<br/>

        Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.<br/>

        Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;<br/>

        Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;<br/>

        Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.<br/>

        What is it else? A madness most discreet,<br/>

        A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.<br/>

        Farewell, my coz.<br/>

    <p id="id00136">  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:<br/>

        This is not Romeo, he's some other where.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00137">  Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?</p>

    <p id="id00138">  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?</p>

    <p id="id00139">  Ben. Groan? Why, no;<br/>

        But sadly tell me who.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00140">  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.<br/>

        Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!<br/>

        In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00141">  Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.</p>

    <p id="id00142">  Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.</p>

    <p id="id00143">  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.</p>

    <p id="id00144">  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit<br/>

        With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,<br/>

        And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,<br/>

        From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.<br/>

        She will not stay the siege of loving terms,<br/>

        Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,<br/>

        Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.<br/>

        O, she's rich in beauty; only poor<br/>

        That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00145">  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?</p>

    <p id="id00146">  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;<br/>

        For beauty, starv'd with her severity,<br/>

        Cuts beauty off from all posterity.<br/>

        She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,<br/>

        To merit bliss by making me despair.<br/>

        She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow<br/>

        Do I live dead that live to tell it now.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00147">  Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.</p>

    <p id="id00148">  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!</p>

    <p id="id00149">  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.<br/>

        Examine other beauties.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00150">  Rom. 'Tis the way<br/>

        To call hers (exquisite) in question more.<br/>

        He that is strucken blind cannot forget<br/>

        The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.<br/>

        Show me a mistress that is passing fair,<br/>

        What doth her beauty serve but as a note<br/>

        Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?<br/>

        Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.<br/>

        'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;<br/>

        And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),<br/>

        Of all the days of the year, upon that day;<br/>

        Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.<br/>

        For even the day before, she broke her brow;<br/>

        And then my husband (God be with his soul!<br/>

        'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?<br/>

        Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;<br/>

        Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,<br/>

        The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'<br/>

        To see now how a jest shall come about!<br/>

        I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,<br/>

        I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,<br/>

        A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;<br/>

        A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.<br/>

        'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?<br/>

        Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;<br/>

        Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'<br/>

        And see how one another lends content;<br/>

        And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies<br/>

        Find written in the margent of his eyes,<br/>

        This precious book of love, this unbound lover,<br/>

        To beautify him only lacks a cover.<br/>

        The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride<br/>

        For fair without the fair within to hide.<br/>

        That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,<br/>

        That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;<br/>

    <p id="id00224">  Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.</p>

    <p id="id00225">  Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes<br/>

        With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead<br/>

        So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00226">  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings<br/>

        And soar with them above a common bound.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00227">  Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft<br/>

        To soar with his light feathers; and so bound<br/>

        I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.<br/>

        Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00228">  Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-<br/>

        Too great oppression for a tender thing.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00229">  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,<br/>

        Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00230">  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.<br/>

        Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.<br/>

        Give me a case to put my visage in.<br/>

        A visor for a visor! What care I<br/>

        What curious eye doth quote deformities?<br/>

        Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.<br/>

        But every man betake him to his legs.<br/>

    <p id="id00232">  Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart<br/>

        Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;<br/>

        For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,<br/>

        I'll be a candle-holder and look on;<br/>

        The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00233">  Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!<br/>

        If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire<br/>

        Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st<br/>

        Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00234">  Rom. Nay, that's not so.</p>

    <p id="id00235">  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay<br/>

        We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.<br/>

        Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits<br/>

        Five times in that ere once in our five wits.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00236">  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;<br/>

        But 'tis no wit to go.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00237">  Mer. Why, may one ask?</p>

    <p id="id00238">  Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.</p>

    <p id="id00239">  Mer. And so did I.</p>

    <p id="id00240">  Rom. Well, what was yours?</p>

    <p id="id00241">  Mer. That dreamers often lie.</p>

    <p id="id00242">  Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.</p>

    <p id="id00243">  Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.<br/>

        She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes<br/>

        In shape no bigger than an agate stone<br/>

        On the forefinger of an alderman,<br/>

        Drawn with a team of little atomies<br/>

        Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;<br/>

        Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,<br/>

        The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;<br/>

        Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;<br/>

        Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;<br/>

        Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;<br/>

        Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,<br/>

        Not half so big as a round little worm<br/>

        Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;<br/>

        Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,<br/>

        Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,<br/>

        Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.<br/>

        And in this state she 'gallops night by night<br/>

        Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;<br/>

        O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;<br/>

        O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;<br/>

        O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,<br/>

        Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,<br/>

        Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.<br/>

        Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,<br/>

        And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;<br/>

        And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail<br/>

        Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,<br/>

        Then dreams he of another benefice.<br/>

        Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,<br/>

        And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,<br/>

        Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,<br/>

        Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon<br/>

        Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,<br/>

        And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two<br/>

        And sleeps again. This is that very Mab<br/>

        That plats the manes of horses in the night<br/>

        And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,<br/>

        Which once untangled much misfortune bodes<br/>

        This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,<br/>

        That presses them and learns them first to bear,<br/>

        Making them women of good carriage.<br/>

        This is she-<br/>

    <p id="id00244">  Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!<br/>

        Thou talk'st of nothing.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00245">  Mer. True, I talk of dreams;<br/>

        Which are the children of an idle brain,<br/>

        Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;<br/>

        Which is as thin of substance as the air,<br/>

        And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes<br/>

        Even now the frozen bosom of the North<br/>

        And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,<br/>

        Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00246">  Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.<br/>

        Supper is done, and we shall come too late.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00247">  Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives<br/>

        Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,<br/>

        Shall bitterly begin his fearful date<br/>

        With this night's revels and expire the term<br/>

        Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,<br/>

        By some vile forfeit of untimely death.<br/>

        Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;<br/>

        Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!<br/>

        Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';<br/>

        Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,<br/>

        One nickname for her purblind son and heir,<br/>

        Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim<br/>

        When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!<br/>

        He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;<br/>

        The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.<br/>

        I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.<br/>

        By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,<br/>

        By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,<br/>

        And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,<br/>

        That in thy likeness thou appear to us!<br/>

    <p id="id00310">  Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.</p>

    <p id="id00311">  Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him<br/>

        To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle<br/>

        Of some strange nature, letting it there stand<br/>

        Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.<br/>

        That were some spite; my invocation<br/>

        Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,<br/>

        I conjure only but to raise up him.<br/>

    <p id="id00312">  Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees<br/>

        To be consorted with the humorous night.<br/>

        Blind is his love and best befits the dark.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00313">  Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.<br/>

        Now will he sit under a medlar tree<br/>

        And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit<br/>

        As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.<br/>

        O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were<br/>

        An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!<br/>

        Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;<br/>

        This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.<br/>

        Come, shall we go?<br/>

    <p id="id00314">  Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain<br/>

    <p id="id00319">    But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?<br/>

        It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!<br/>

        Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,<br/>

        Who is already sick and pale with grief<br/>

        That thou her maid art far more fair than she.<br/>

        Be not her maid, since she is envious.<br/>

        Her vestal livery is but sick and green,<br/>

        And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.<br/>

        It is my lady; O, it is my love!<br/>

        O that she knew she were!<br/>

        She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?<br/>

        Her eye discourses; I will answer it.<br/>

        I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.<br/>

        Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,<br/>

        Having some business, do entreat her eyes<br/>

        To twinkle in their spheres till they return.<br/>

        What if her eyes were there, they in her head?<br/>

        The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars<br/>

        As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven<br/>

        Would through the airy region stream so bright<br/>

        That birds would sing and think it were not night.<br/>

        See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!<br/>

        O that I were a glove upon that hand,<br/>

        That I might touch that cheek!<br/>

    <p id="id00320">  Jul. Ay me!</p>

    <p id="id00321">  Rom. She speaks.<br/>

        O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art<br/>

        As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,<br/>

        As is a winged messenger of heaven<br/>

        Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes<br/>

        Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him<br/>

        When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds<br/>

        And sails upon the bosom of the air.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00322">  Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?<br/>

        Deny thy father and refuse thy name!<br/>

        Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,<br/>

        And I'll no longer be a Capulet.<br/>

    <p id="id00323">  Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?</p>

    <p id="id00324">  Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.<br/>

        Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.<br/>

        What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,<br/>

        Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part<br/>

        Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!<br/>

        What's in a name? That which we call a rose<br/>

        By any other name would smell as sweet.<br/>

        So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,<br/>

        Retain that dear perfection which he owes<br/>

        Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;<br/>

        And for that name, which is no part of thee,<br/>

        Take all myself.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00325">  Rom. I take thee at thy word.<br/>

        Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;<br/>

        Henceforth I never will be Romeo.<br/>

    <p id="id00326">  Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,<br/>

        So stumblest on my counsel?<br/>

    <p id="id00327">  Rom. By a name<br/>

        I know not how to tell thee who I am.<br/>

        My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,<br/>

        Because it is an enemy to thee.<br/>

        Had I it written, I would tear the word.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00328">  Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words<br/>

        Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.<br/>

        Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00329">  Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.</p>

    <p id="id00330">  Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?<br/>

        The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,<br/>

        And the place death, considering who thou art,<br/>

        If any of my kinsmen find thee here.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00331">  Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;<br/>

        For stony limits cannot hold love out,<br/>

        And what love can do, that dares love attempt.<br/>

        Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00332">  Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.</p>

    <p id="id00333">  Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye<br/>

        Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,<br/>

        And I am proof against their enmity.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00334">  Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.</p>

    <p id="id00335">  Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;<br/>

        And but thou love me, let them find me here.<br/>

        My life were better ended by their hate<br/>

        Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00336">  Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?</p>

    <p id="id00337">  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.<br/>

        He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.<br/>

        I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far<br/>

        As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,<br/>

        I would adventure for such merchandise.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00338">  Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;<br/>

        Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek<br/>

        For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.<br/>

        Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny<br/>

        What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!<br/>

        Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';<br/>

        And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,<br/>

        Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,<br/>

        They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,<br/>

        If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.<br/>

        Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,<br/>

        I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,<br/>

        So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.<br/>

        In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,<br/>

        And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;<br/>

        But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true<br/>

        Than those that have more cunning to be strange.<br/>

        I should have been more strange, I must confess,<br/>

        But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,<br/>

        My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,<br/>

        And not impute this yielding to light love,<br/>

        Which the dark night hath so discovered.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00339">  Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,<br/>

        That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00340">  Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,<br/>

        That monthly changes in her circled orb,<br/>

        Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00341">  Rom. What shall I swear by?</p>

    <p id="id00342">  Jul. Do not swear at all;<br/>

        Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,<br/>

        Which is the god of my idolatry,<br/>

        And I'll believe thee.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00343">  Rom. If my heart's dear love-</p>

    <p id="id00344">  Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,<br/>

        I have no joy of this contract to-night.<br/>

        It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;<br/>

        Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be<br/>

        Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!<br/>

        This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,<br/>

        May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.<br/>

        Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest<br/>

        Come to thy heart as that within my breast!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00345">  Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</p>

    <p id="id00346">  Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?</p>

    <p id="id00347">  Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.</p>

    <p id="id00348">  Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;<br/>

        And yet I would it were to give again.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00349">  Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?</p>

    <p id="id00350">  Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.<br/>

        And yet I wish but for the thing I have.<br/>

        My bounty is as boundless as the sea,<br/>

        My love as deep; the more I give to thee,<br/>

        The more I have, for both are infinite.<br/>

        I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!<br/>

                                               [Nurse] calls within.<br/>

        Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.<br/>

        And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels<br/>

        From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.<br/>

        Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye<br/>

        The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,<br/>

        I must up-fill this osier cage of ours<br/>

        With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.<br/>

        The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.<br/>

        What is her burying gave, that is her womb;<br/>

        And from her womb children of divers kind<br/>

        We sucking on her natural bosom find;<br/>

        Many for many virtues excellent,<br/>

        None but for some, and yet all different.<br/>

        O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies<br/>

        In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;<br/>

        For naught so vile that on the earth doth live<br/>

        But to the earth some special good doth give;<br/>

        Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,<br/>

        Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.<br/>

        Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,<br/>

        And vice sometime's by action dignified.<br/>

        Within the infant rind of this small flower<br/>

        Poison hath residence, and medicine power;<br/>

        For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;<br/>

        Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.<br/>

        Two such opposed kings encamp them still<br/>

        In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;<br/>

        And where the worser is predominant,<br/>

        Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.<br/>

        Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,<br/>

        And where care lodges sleep will never lie;<br/>

        But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain<br/>

        Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.<br/>

        Therefore thy earliness doth me assure<br/>

        Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;<br/>

        By holy marriage. When, and where, and how<br/>

        We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,<br/>

        I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,<br/>

        That thou consent to marry us to-day.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00389">  Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!<br/>

        Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,<br/>

        So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies<br/>

        Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.<br/>

        Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine<br/>

        Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!<br/>

        How much salt water thrown away in waste,<br/>

        To season love, that of it doth not taste!<br/>

        The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,<br/>

        Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.<br/>

        Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit<br/>

        Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.<br/>

        If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,<br/>

        Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.<br/>

        And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:<br/>

        Women may fall when there's no strength in men.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00390">  Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.</p>

    <p id="id00391">  Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.</p>

    <p id="id00392">  Rom. And bad'st me bury love.</p>

    <p id="id00393">  Friar. Not in a grave<br/>

        To lay one in, another out to have.<br/>

    <p id="id00394">  Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now<br/>

        Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.<br/>

        The other did not so.<br/>

    <p id="id00395">  Friar. O, she knew well<br/>

        Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.<br/>

        But come, young waverer, come go with me.<br/>

        In one respect I'll thy assistant be;<br/>

        For this alliance may so happy prove<br/>

        To turn your households' rancour to pure love.<br/>

    <p id="id00401">  Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.</p>

    <p id="id00402">  Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,<br/>

        Torments him so that he will sure run mad.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00403">  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,<br/>

        Hath sent a letter to his father's house.<br/>

        being dared.</p>

        wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
        very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's
        butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?</p>

    <p id="id00409">  Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?</p>

    <p id="id00410" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the
        courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
        pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his
        minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very
        butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman
        of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the
        immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.</p>

    <p id="id00411">  Ben. The what?</p>

    <p id="id00412" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-
        these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very
        tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
        grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
        flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand
        so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old

    <p id="id00415" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how
        art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch
        flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she
        had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
        Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,
        but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French
        salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
        fairly last night.</p>

    <p id="id00416">  Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?</p>

    <p id="id00417">  Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?</p>

    <p id="id00418">  Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a<br/>

        case as mine a man may strain courtesy.<br/>

    <p id="id00427" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out
        thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may
        remain, after the wearing, solely singular.</p>

    <p id="id00428">  Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!</p>

    <p id="id00429">  Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.</p>

    <p id="id00431" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for
        thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am
        sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?</p>

    <p id="id00432" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not

    <p id="id00436">  Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?</p>

    <p id="id00437">  Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch<br/>

        narrow to an ell broad!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00438">  Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to<br/>

        the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00439" style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%">  Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now
        art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by
        art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a
        great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in
        a hole.</p>

        was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to

                       But a hare that is hoar<br/>

                       Is too much for a score<br/>

        will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead
        her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of
        behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and
        therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were
        an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.</p>

    <p id="id00476">  Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto<br/>

        choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better<br/>

        than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a<br/>

        foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet<br/>

        they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll<br/>

        warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve<br/>

    God.<br/>

        What, have you din'd at home?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00508">  Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.<br/>

        What says he of our marriage? What of that?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00509">  Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!<br/>

        It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.<br/>

        My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!<br/>

        Beshrew your heart for sending me about<br/>

        To catch my death with jauncing up and down!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00510">  Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.<br/>

        Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00511">  Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,<br/>

        and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where<br/>

        is your mother?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00512">  Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.<br/>

        Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!<br/>

        'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,<br/>

        "Where is your mother?"'<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00513">  Nurse. O God's Lady dear!<br/>

        Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.<br/>

        Is this the poultice for my aching bones?<br/>

        Henceforward do your messages yourself.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00514">  Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?</p>

    <p id="id00515">  Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?</p>

    <p id="id00516">  Jul. I have.</p>

    <p id="id00517">  Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;<br/>

        There stays a husband to make you a wife.<br/>

        Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:<br/>

        They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.<br/>

        Hie you to church; I must another way,<br/>

        To fetch a ladder, by the which your love<br/>

        Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.<br/>

        I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;<br/>

        But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.<br/>

        Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00518">  Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.<br/>

                                                             Exeunt.<br/>

        This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue<br/>

        Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
        other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an
        eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels
        as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as
        addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a
        man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog
        that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a
        tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with
        another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
        tutor me from quarrelling!</p>

        His fault concludes but what the law should end,<br/>

        The life of Tybalt.<br/>

    <p id="id00599">  Prince. And for that offence<br/>

        Immediately we do exile him hence.<br/>

        I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,<br/>

        I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;<br/>

        Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.<br/>

    <p id="id00601">Enter Juliet alone.</p>

    <p id="id00602" style="margin-top: 2em">  Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,<br/>

        Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner<br/>

        As Phaeton would whip you to the West<br/>

        And bring in cloudy night immediately.<br/>

        Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,<br/>

        That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo<br/>

        Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.<br/>

        Lovers can see to do their amorous rites<br/>

        By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,<br/>

        It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,<br/>

        Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,<br/>

        And learn me how to lose a winning match,<br/>

        Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.<br/>

        Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,<br/>

        With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,<br/>

        Think true love acted simple modesty.<br/>

        Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;<br/>

        For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night<br/>

        Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.<br/>

        Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;<br/>

        Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,<br/>

        Take him and cut him out in little stars,<br/>

        And he will make the face of heaven so fine<br/>

        That all the world will be in love with night<br/>

        And pay no worship to the garish sun.<br/>

        O, I have bought the mansion of a love,<br/>

        But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,<br/>

        Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day<br/>

        As is the night before some festival<br/>

        To an impatient child that hath new robes<br/>

        And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00603">                Enter Nurse, with cords.</p>

    <p id="id00604">    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks<br/>

        But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.<br/>

        Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords<br/>

        That Romeo bid thee fetch?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00605">  Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.<br/>

                                                 [Throws them down.]<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00606">  Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands</p>

    <p id="id00607">  Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!<br/>

        We are undone, lady, we are undone!<br/>

        Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00608">  Jul. Can heaven be so envious?</p>

    <p id="id00609">  Nurse. Romeo can,<br/>

        Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!<br/>

        Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00610">  Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?<br/>

        This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.<br/>

        Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'<br/>

        And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more<br/>

        Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.<br/>

        I am not I, if there be such an 'I';<br/>

        Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'<br/>

        If be be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'<br/>

        Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00611">  Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,<br/>

        (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.<br/>

        A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;<br/>

        Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,<br/>

        All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00612">  Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!<br/>

        To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!<br/>

        Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,<br/>

        And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00613">  Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!<br/>

        O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman<br/>

        That ever I should live to see thee dead!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00614">  Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?<br/>

        Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?<br/>

        My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?<br/>

        Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!<br/>

        For who is living, if those two are gone?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00615">  Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;<br/>

        Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00616">  Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?</p>

    <p id="id00617">  Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!</p>

    <p id="id00618">  Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!<br/>

        Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?<br/>

        Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!<br/>

        Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!<br/>

        Despised substance of divinest show!<br/>

        Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-<br/>

        A damned saint, an honourable villain!<br/>

        O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell<br/>

        When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend<br/>

        In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?<br/>

        Was ever book containing such vile matter<br/>

        So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell<br/>

        In such a gorgeous palace!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00619">  Nurse. There's no trust,<br/>

        No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,<br/>

        All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.<br/>

        Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.<br/>

        These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.<br/>

        Shame come to Romeo!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00620">  Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue<br/>

        For such a wish! He was not born to shame.<br/>

        Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;<br/>

        For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd<br/>

        Sole monarch of the universal earth.<br/>

        O, what a beast was I to chide at him!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00621">  Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?</p>

    <p id="id00622">  Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?<br/>

        Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name<br/>

        When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?<br/>

        But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?<br/>

        That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.<br/>

        Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!<br/>

        Your tributary drops belong to woe,<br/>

        Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.<br/>

        My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;<br/>

        And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.<br/>

        All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?<br/>

        Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,<br/>

        That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;<br/>

        But O, it presses to my memory<br/>

        Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!<br/>

        'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'<br/>

        That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'<br/>

        Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death<br/>

        Was woe enough, if it had ended there;<br/>

        Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship<br/>

        And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,<br/>

        Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'<br/>

        Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,<br/>

        Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?<br/>

        But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,<br/>

        'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word<br/>

        Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,<br/>

        All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-<br/>

        There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,<br/>

        In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.<br/>

        Where is my father and my mother, nurse?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00623">  Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.<br/>

        Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00624">  Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,<br/>

        When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.<br/>

        Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,<br/>

        Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.<br/>

        He made you for a highway to my bed;<br/>

        But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.<br/>

        Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;<br/>

        And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00625">  Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo<br/>

        To comfort you. I wot well where he is.<br/>

        Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.<br/>

        I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00626">  Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight<br/>

        And bid him come to take his last farewell.<br/>

                                                             Exeunt.<br/>

        Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,<br/>

    <p id="id00630">                         Enter Romeo.</p>

    <p id="id00631" style="margin-top: 2em">  Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom<br/>

        What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand<br/>

        That I yet know not?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00632">  Friar. Too familiar<br/>

        Is my dear son with such sour company.<br/>

        I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00633">  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?</p>

    <p id="id00634">  Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-<br/>

        Not body's death, but body's banishment.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00635">  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';<br/>

        For exile hath more terror in his look,<br/>

        Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00636">  Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.<br/>

        Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00637">  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,<br/>

        But purgatory, torture, hell itself.<br/>

        Hence banished is banish'd from the world,<br/>

        And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'<br/>

        Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'<br/>

        Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe<br/>

        And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00638">  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!<br/>

        Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,<br/>

        Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,<br/>

        And turn'd that black word death to banishment.<br/>

        This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00639">  Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,<br/>

        Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog<br/>

        And little mouse, every unworthy thing,<br/>

        Live here in heaven and may look on her;<br/>

        But Romeo may not. More validity,<br/>

        More honourable state, more courtship lives<br/>

        In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize<br/>

        On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand<br/>

        And steal immortal blessing from her lips,<br/>

        Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,<br/>

        Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;<br/>

        But Romeo may not- he is banished.<br/>

        This may flies do, when I from this must fly;<br/>

        They are free men, but I am banished.<br/>

        And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?<br/>

        Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,<br/>

        No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,<br/>

        But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?<br/>

        O friar, the damned use that word in hell;<br/>

        Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,<br/>

        Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,<br/>

        A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,<br/>

        To mangle me with that word 'banished'?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00640">  Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.</p>

    <p id="id00641">  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.</p>

    <p id="id00642">  Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;<br/>

        Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,<br/>

        To comfort thee, though thou art banished.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00643">  Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!<br/>

        Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,<br/>

        Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,<br/>

        It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00644">  Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.</p>

    <p id="id00645">  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?</p>

    <p id="id00646">  Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.</p>

    <p id="id00647">  Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.<br/>

        Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,<br/>

        An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,<br/>

        Doting like me, and like me banished,<br/>

        Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,<br/>

        And fall upon the ground, as I do now,<br/>

        Taking the measure of an unmade grave.<br/>

                                                     Knock [within].<br/>

        With blood remov'd but little from her own?<br/>

        Where is she? and how doth she! and what says<br/>

        My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00662">  Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;<br/>

        And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,<br/>

        And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,<br/>

        And then down falls again.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00663">  Rom. As if that name,<br/>

        Shot from the deadly level of a gun,<br/>

        Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand<br/>

        Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,<br/>

        In what vile part of this anatomy<br/>

        Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack<br/>

        The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]<br/>

        The unreasonable fury of a beast.<br/>

        Unseemly woman in a seeming man!<br/>

        Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!<br/>

        Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,<br/>

        I thought thy disposition better temper'd.<br/>

        Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?<br/>

        And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,<br/>

        By doing damned hate upon thyself?<br/>

        Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?<br/>

        Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet<br/>

        In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.<br/>

        Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,<br/>

        Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,<br/>

        And usest none in that true use indeed<br/>

        Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.<br/>

        Thy noble shape is but a form of wax<br/>

        Digressing from the valour of a man;<br/>

        Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,<br/>

        Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;<br/>

        Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,<br/>

        Misshapen in the conduct of them both,<br/>

        Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,<br/>

        is get afire by thine own ignorance,<br/>

        And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.<br/>

        What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,<br/>

        For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.<br/>

        There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,<br/>

        But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.<br/>

        The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend<br/>

        And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.<br/>

        A pack of blessings light upon thy back;<br/>

        Happiness courts thee in her best array;<br/>

        But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,<br/>

        Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.<br/>

        Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.<br/>

        Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,<br/>

        Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.<br/>

        But look thou stay not till the watch be set,<br/>

        For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,<br/>

        Where thou shalt live till we can find a time<br/>

        To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,<br/>

        Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back<br/>

        With twenty hundred thousand times more joy<br/>

        Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.<br/>

        Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,<br/>

        And bid her hasten all the house to bed,<br/>

        Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.<br/>

        Romeo is coming.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00665">  Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night<br/>

        To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!<br/>

        My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00666">  Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.</p>

    <p id="id00667">  Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.<br/>

        Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00668">  Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!</p>

    <p id="id00669">  Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:<br/>

        Either be gone before the watch be set,<br/>

        Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.<br/>

        Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,<br/>

        And he shall signify from time to time<br/>

        Every good hap to you that chances here.<br/>

        Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00670">  Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,<br/>

        It were a grief so brief to part with thee.<br/>

        Farewell.<br/>

                                                             Exeunt.<br/>

    <p id="id00672">Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.</p>

    <p id="id00673" style="margin-top: 2em">  Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily<br/>

        That we have had no time to move our daughter.<br/>

        Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,<br/>

        And so did I. Well, we were born to die.<br/>

        'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.<br/>

        I promise you, but for your company,<br/>

        I would have been abed an hour ago.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00674">  Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.<br/>

        Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00675">  Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;<br/>

        To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.<br/>

    <p id="id00676">  Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender<br/>

        Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd<br/>

        In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.<br/>

        Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;<br/>

        Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love<br/>

        And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-<br/>

        But, soft! what day is this?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00677">  Par. Monday, my lord.</p>

    <p id="id00678">  Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.<br/>

        Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her<br/>

        She shall be married to this noble earl.<br/>

        Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?<br/>

        We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;<br/>

        For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,<br/>

        It may be thought we held him carelessly,<br/>

        Being our kinsman, if we revel much.<br/>

        Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,<br/>

        And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00679">  Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.</p>

    <p id="id00680">  Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.<br/>

        Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;<br/>

    <p id="id00683" style="margin-top: 2em">  Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.<br/>

        It was the nightingale, and not the lark,<br/>

        That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.<br/>

        Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.<br/>

        Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00684">  Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;<br/>

        No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks<br/>

        Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.<br/>

        Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day<br/>

        Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.<br/>

        I must be gone and live, or stay and die.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00685">  Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.<br/>

        It is some meteor that the sun exhales<br/>

        To be to thee this night a torchbearer<br/>

        And light thee on the way to Mantua.<br/>

        Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00686">  Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.<br/>

        I am content, so thou wilt have it so.<br/>

        I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,<br/>

        'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;<br/>

        Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat<br/>

        The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.<br/>

        I have more care to stay than will to go.<br/>

        Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.<br/>

        How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00687">  Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!<br/>

        It is the lark that sings so out of tune,<br/>

        Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.<br/>

        Some say the lark makes sweet division;<br/>

        This doth not so, for she divideth us.<br/>

        Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;<br/>

        O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,<br/>

        Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,<br/>

        Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!<br/>

        O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.<br/>

        Ere I again behold my Romeo!<br/>

    <p id="id00697">  Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?</p>

    <p id="id00698">  Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve<br/>

        For sweet discourses in our time to come.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00699">  Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!<br/>

        Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,<br/>

        As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.<br/>

        Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00700">  Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.<br/>

        Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!<br/>

    Exit.<br/>

    <p id="id00702">  Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?</p>

    <p id="id00703">  Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.<br/>

        Is she not down so late, or up so early?<br/>

        What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00704">                       Enter Mother.</p>

    <p id="id00705" style="margin-top: 2em">  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?</p>

    <p id="id00706">  Jul. Madam, I am not well.</p>

    <p id="id00707">  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?<br/>

        What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?<br/>

        An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.<br/>

        Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;<br/>

        But much of grief shows still some want of wit.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00708">  Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.</p>

    <p id="id00709">  Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend<br/>

        Which you weep for.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00710">  Jul. Feeling so the loss,<br/>

        I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00711">  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death<br/>

        As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00712">  Jul. What villain, madam?</p>

    <p id="id00713">  Lady. That same villain Romeo.</p>

    <p id="id00714">  Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-<br/>

        God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;<br/>

        And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00715">  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.</p>

    <p id="id00716">  Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.<br/>

        Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00717">  Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.<br/>

        Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,<br/>

        Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,<br/>

        Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram<br/>

        That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;<br/>

        And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00718">  Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied<br/>

        With Romeo till I behold him- dead-<br/>

        Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.<br/>

        Madam, if you could find out but a man<br/>

        To bear a poison, I would temper it;<br/>

        That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,<br/>

        Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors<br/>

        To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,<br/>

        To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt<br/>

        Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00719">  Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.<br/>

        But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00720">  Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.<br/>

        What are they, I beseech your ladyship?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00721">  Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;<br/>

        One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,<br/>

        Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy<br/>

        That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00722">  Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?</p>

    <p id="id00723">  Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn<br/>

        The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,<br/>

        The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,<br/>

        Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00724">  Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,<br/>

        He shall not make me there a joyful bride!<br/>

        I wonder at this haste, that I must wed<br/>

        Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.<br/>

        I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,<br/>

        I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear<br/>

        It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,<br/>

        Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00725">  Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,<br/>

        And see how be will take it at your hands.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00726">                   Enter Capulet and Nurse.</p>

    <p id="id00727" style="margin-top: 2em">  Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,<br/>

        But for the sunset of my brother's son<br/>

        It rains downright.<br/>

        How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?<br/>

        Evermore show'ring? In one little body<br/>

        Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:<br/>

        For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,<br/>

        Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is<br/>

        Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,<br/>

        Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,<br/>

        Without a sudden calm will overset<br/>

        Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?<br/>

        Have you delivered to her our decree?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00728">  Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.<br/>

        I would the fool were married to her grave!<br/>

    <p id="id00729">  Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.<br/>

        How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?<br/>

        Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,<br/>

        Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought<br/>

        So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00730">  Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.<br/>

        Proud can I never be of what I hate,<br/>

        But thankful even for hate that is meant love.<br/>

    <p id="id00731">  Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?<br/>

        'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-<br/>

        And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,<br/>

        Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,<br/>

        But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next<br/>

        To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,<br/>

        Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.<br/>

        Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!<br/>

        You tallow-face!<br/>

    <p id="id00732">  Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?</p>

    <p id="id00733">  Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,<br/>

        Hear me with patience but to speak a word.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00734">  Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!<br/>

        I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday<br/>

        Or never after look me in the face.<br/>

        Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!<br/>

        My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest<br/>

        That God had lent us but this only child;<br/>

        But now I see this one is one too much,<br/>

        And that we have a curse in having her.<br/>

        Out on her, hilding!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00735">  Nurse. God in heaven bless her!<br/>

        You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00736">  Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,<br/>

        Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!<br/>

    <p id="id00737">  Nurse. I speak no treason.</p>

    <p id="id00739">  Nurse. May not one speak?</p>

    <p id="id00740">  Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!<br/>

        Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,<br/>

        For here we need it not.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00741">  Lady. You are too hot.</p>

    <p id="id00742">  Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,<br/>

        At home, abroad, alone, in company,<br/>

        Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been<br/>

        To have her match'd; and having now provided<br/>

        A gentleman of princely parentage,<br/>

        Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,<br/>

        Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,<br/>

        Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-<br/>

        And then to have a wretched puling fool,<br/>

        A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,<br/>

        To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;<br/>

        I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!<br/>

        But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.<br/>

        Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.<br/>

        Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.<br/>

        Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:<br/>

        An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;<br/>

        An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,<br/>

        For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,<br/>

        Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.<br/>

        Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.<br/>

    <p id="id00743">  Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds<br/>

        That sees into the bottom of my grief?<br/>

        O sweet my mother, cast me not away!<br/>

        Delay this marriage for a month, a week;<br/>

        Or if you do not, make the bridal bed<br/>

        In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.<br/>

    <p id="id00745">  Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?<br/>

        My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.<br/>

        How shall that faith return again to earth<br/>

        Unless that husband send it me from heaven<br/>

        By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.<br/>

        Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems<br/>

        Upon so soft a subject as myself!<br/>

        What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?<br/>

        Some comfort, nurse.<br/>

    <p id="id00746">  Nurse. Faith, here it is.<br/>

        Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing<br/>

        That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;<br/>

        Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.<br/>

        Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,<br/>

        I think it best you married with the County.<br/>

        O, he's a lovely gentleman!<br/>

        Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,<br/>

        Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye<br/>

        As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,<br/>

        I think you are happy in this second match,<br/>

        For it excels your first; or if it did not,<br/>

        Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were<br/>

        As living here and you no use of him.<br/>

    <p id="id00750">  Nurse. What?</p>

    <p id="id00751">  Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.<br/>

        Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,<br/>

        Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,<br/>

        To make confession and to be absolv'd.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00752">  Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.</p>

    <p id="id00753">  Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!<br/>

        Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,<br/>

        Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue<br/>

        Which she hath prais'd him with above compare<br/>

        So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!<br/>

        Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.<br/>

        I'll to the friar to know his remedy.<br/>

        If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.<br/>

    <p id="id00755">Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.</p>

    <p id="id00756" style="margin-top: 2em">  Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.</p>

    <p id="id00757">  Par. My father Capulet will have it so,<br/>

        And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00758">  Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.<br/>

        Uneven is the course; I like it not.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00759">  Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,<br/>

        And therefore have I little talk'd of love;<br/>

        For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.<br/>

        Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous<br/>

        That she do give her sorrow so much sway,<br/>

        And in his wisdom hastes our marriage<br/>

        To stop the inundation of her tears,<br/>

        Which, too much minded by herself alone,<br/>

        May be put from her by society.<br/>

        Now do you know the reason of this haste.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00760">  Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-<br/>

        Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.<br/>

    <p id="id00762" style="margin-top: 2em">  Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!</p>

    <p id="id00763">  Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.</p>

    <p id="id00764">  Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.</p>

    <p id="id00765">  Jul. What must be shall be.</p>

    <p id="id00766">  Friar. That's a certain text.</p>

    <p id="id00767">  Par. Come you to make confession to this father?</p>

    <p id="id00768">  Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.</p>

    <p id="id00769">  Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.</p>

    <p id="id00770">  Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.</p>

    <p id="id00771">  Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.</p>

    <p id="id00772">  Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,<br/>

        Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00773">  Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.</p>

    <p id="id00774">  Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,<br/>

        For it was bad enough before their spite.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00775">  Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.</p>

    <p id="id00776">  Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;<br/>

        And what I spake, I spake it to my face.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00777">  Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.</p>

    <p id="id00778">  Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.<br/>

        Are you at leisure, holy father, now,<br/>

        Or shall I come to you at evening mass<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00779">  Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.<br/>

        My lord, we must entreat the time alone.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00780">  Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!<br/>

        Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.<br/>

        Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00781">  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,<br/>

        Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00782">  Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;<br/>

        It strains me past the compass of my wits.<br/>

        I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,<br/>

        On Thursday next be married to this County.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00783">  Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,<br/>

        Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.<br/>

        If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,<br/>

        Do thou but call my resolution wise<br/>

        And with this knife I'll help it presently.<br/>

        God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;<br/>

        And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,<br/>

        Shall be the label to another deed,<br/>

        Or my true heart with treacherous revolt<br/>

        Turn to another, this shall slay them both.<br/>

        Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,<br/>

        Give me some present counsel; or, behold,<br/>

        'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife<br/>

        Shall play the empire, arbitrating that<br/>

        Which the commission of thy years and art<br/>

        Could to no issue of true honour bring.<br/>

        Be not so long to speak. I long to die<br/>

        If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00784">  Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,<br/>

        Which craves as desperate an execution<br/>

        As that is desperate which we would prevent.<br/>

        If, rather than to marry County Paris<br/>

        Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,<br/>

        Then is it likely thou wilt undertake<br/>

        A thing like death to chide away this shame,<br/>

        That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;<br/>

        And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00785">  Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,<br/>

        From off the battlements of yonder tower,<br/>

        Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk<br/>

        Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,<br/>

        Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,<br/>

        O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,<br/>

        With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;<br/>

        Or bid me go into a new-made grave<br/>

        And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-<br/>

        Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-<br/>

        And I will do it without fear or doubt,<br/>

        To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00786">  Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent<br/>

        To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.<br/>

        To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;<br/>

        Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.<br/>

        Take thou this vial, being then in bed,<br/>

        And this distilled liquor drink thou off;<br/>

        When presently through all thy veins shall run<br/>

        A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse<br/>

        Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;<br/>

        No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;<br/>

        The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade<br/>

        To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall<br/>

        Like death when he shuts up the day of life;<br/>

        Each part, depriv'd of supple government,<br/>

        Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;<br/>

        And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death<br/>

        Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,<br/>

        And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.<br/>

        Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes<br/>

        To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.<br/>

        Then, as the manner of our country is,<br/>

        In thy best robes uncovered on the bier<br/>

        Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault<br/>

        Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.<br/>

        In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,<br/>

        Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;<br/>

        And hither shall he come; and he and I<br/>

        Will watch thy waking, and that very night<br/>

        Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.<br/>

        And this shall free thee from this present shame,<br/>

        If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear<br/>

        Abate thy valour in the acting it.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00787">  Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!</p>

    <p id="id00788">  Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous<br/>

        In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed<br/>

        To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00789">  Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.<br/>

        O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,<br/>

        Environed with all these hideous fears,<br/>

        Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift<br/>

        To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!<br/>

        I do remember an apothecary,<br/>

        And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted<br/>

        In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,<br/>

        Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,<br/>

        Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;<br/>

        And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,<br/>

        An alligator stuff'd, and other skins<br/>

        Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves<br/>

        A beggarly account of empty boxes,<br/>

        Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,<br/>

        Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses<br/>

        Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.<br/>

        Noting this penury, to myself I said,<br/>

        'An if a man did need a poison now<br/>

        Whose sale is present death in Mantua,<br/>

        Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'<br/>

        O, this same thought did but forerun my need,<br/>

        And this same needy man must sell it me.<br/>

        As I remember, this should be the house.<br/>

        As will disperse itself through all the veins<br/>

        That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,<br/>

        And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath<br/>

        As violently as hasty powder fir'd<br/>

        The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;<br/>

        The world affords no law to make thee rich;<br/>

    <p id="id00907">  Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?</p>

    <p id="id00908">  John. I could not send it- here it is again-<br/>

        Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,<br/>

        So fearful were they of infection.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00909">  Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,<br/>

        The letter was not nice, but full of charge,<br/>

        Of dear import; and the neglecting it<br/>

        May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,<br/>

        Get me an iron crow and bring it straight<br/>

        Unto my cell.<br/>

        Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.<br/>

        She will beshrew me much that Romeo<br/>

        Hath had no notice of these accidents;<br/>

        But I will write again to Mantua,<br/>

        And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-<br/>

        Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.<br/>

        Why I descend into this bed of death<br/>

        But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger<br/>

        A precious ring- a ring that I must use<br/>

        In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.<br/>

        But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry<br/>

        In what I farther shall intend to do,<br/>

        By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint<br/>

    <p id="id00929">  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.<br/>

        Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!<br/>

        What said my man when my betossed soul<br/>

        Did not attend him as we rode? I think<br/>

        He told me Paris should have married Juliet.<br/>

        Said he not so? or did I dream it so?<br/>

        Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet<br/>

        To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,<br/>

        One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!<br/>

        I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.<br/>

        A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,<br/>

        For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes<br/>

        This vault a feasting presence full of light.<br/>

        Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.<br/>

                                             [Lays him in the tomb.]<br/>

        How oft when men are at the point of death<br/>

        Have they been merry! which their keepers call<br/>

        A lightning before death. O, how may I<br/>

        Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!<br/>

        Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,<br/>

        Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.<br/>

        Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet<br/>

        Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,<br/>

        And death's pale flag is not advanced there.<br/>

        Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?<br/>

        O, what more favour can I do to thee<br/>

        Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain<br/>

        To sunder his that was thine enemy?<br/>

        Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,<br/>

        Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe<br/>

        That unsubstantial Death is amorous,<br/>

        And that the lean abhorred monster keeps<br/>

        Thee here in dark to be his paramour?<br/>

        For fear of that I still will stay with thee<br/>

        And never from this palace of dim night<br/>

        Depart again. Here, here will I remain<br/>

        With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here<br/>

        Will I set up my everlasting rest<br/>

        And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars<br/>

        From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!<br/>

        Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you<br/>

        The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss<br/>

        A dateless bargain to engrossing death!<br/>

        Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!<br/>

        Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on<br/>

        The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!<br/>

        Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!<br/>

        Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.<br/>

        To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]<br/>

        Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?<br/>

        And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour<br/>

        Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.<br/>

        O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop<br/>

        To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.<br/>

        Haply some poison yet doth hang on them<br/>

        Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;<br/>

        And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.<br/>

        I married them; and their stol'n marriage day<br/>

        Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death<br/>

        Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;<br/>

        For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.<br/>

        You, to remove that siege of grief from her,<br/>

        Betroth'd and would have married her perforce<br/>

        To County Paris. Then comes she to me<br/>

        And with wild looks bid me devise some mean<br/>

        To rid her from this second marriage,<br/>

        Or in my cell there would she kill herself.<br/>

        Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)<br/>

        A sleeping potion; which so took effect<br/>

        As I intended, for it wrought on her<br/>

        The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo<br/>

        That he should hither come as this dire night<br/>

        To help to take her from her borrowed grave,<br/>

        Being the time the potion's force should cease.<br/>

        But he which bore my letter, Friar John,<br/>

        Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight<br/>

        Return'd my letter back. Then all alone<br/>

        At the prefixed hour of her waking<br/>

        Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;<br/>

        Meaning to keep her closely at my cell<br/>

        Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.<br/>

        But when I came, some minute ere the time<br/>

        Of her awaking, here untimely lay<br/>

        The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.<br/>

        She wakes; and I entreated her come forth<br/>

        And bear this work of heaven with patience;<br/>

        But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,<br/>

        And she, too desperate, would not go with me,<br/>

        But, as it seems, did violence on herself.<br/>

        All this I know, and to the marriage<br/>

        Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this<br/>

        Miscarried by my fault, let my old life<br/>

        Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,<br/>

        Unto the rigour of severest law.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00977">  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.<br/>

        Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00978">  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;<br/>

        And then in post he came from Mantua<br/>

        To this same place, to this same monument.<br/>

        This letter he early bid me give his father,<br/>

        And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,<br/>

        If I departed not and left him there.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00979">  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.<br/>

        Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?<br/>

        Sirrah, what made your master in this place?<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00980">  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;<br/>

        And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.<br/>

        Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;<br/>

        And by-and-by my master drew on him;<br/>

        And then I ran away to call the watch.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00981">  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,<br/>

        Their course of love, the tidings of her death;<br/>

        And here he writes that he did buy a poison<br/>

        Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal<br/>

        Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.<br/>

        Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,<br/>

        See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,<br/>

        That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!<br/>

        And I, for winking at you, discords too,<br/>

        Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00982">  Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.<br/>

        This is my daughter's jointure, for no more<br/>

        Can I demand.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00983">  Mon. But I can give thee more;<br/>

        For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,<br/>

        That whiles Verona by that name is known,<br/>

        There shall no figure at such rate be set<br/>

        As that of true and faithful Juliet.<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00984">  Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-<br/>

        Poor sacrifices of our enmity!<br/>
    </p>

    <p id="id00985">  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.<br/>

        The sun for sorrow will not show his head.<br/>

        Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;<br/>

        Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;<br/>

        For never was a story of more woe<br/>

        Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.<br/>

                                                       Exeunt omnes.<br/>

<p id="id01016">1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<h4 id="id01022" style="margin-top: 2em">Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h4>

<p id="id01023">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p id="id01024">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h4 id="id01029" style="margin-top: 2em">Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h4>

<p id="id01030">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p id="id01031">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org</p>

<p id="id01032">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p id="id01033">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p id="id01034">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h4 id="id01035" style="margin-top: 2em">Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h4>

<p id="id01036">Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p id="id01037" style="margin-top: 2em">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p id="id01038" style="margin-top: 2em">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:</p>
